> This software is currently under development. The analysis algorithms and display logic are not perfect. Please use the App with the understanding that it may contain known bugs or unexpected behavior.

### 1. Accuracy of Information
The seat maps and flight information provided by the App are results of analyzing external data acquired via the Amadeus API. We do not constantly guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of such content. Actual conditions may differ due to airline circumstances (aircraft changes, system maintenance, etc.). Users should use the information at their own discretion and responsibility.

### 2. Use of Third-Party Services
The App uses the Amadeus Developers system. It adheres to the terms and policies of the service provider and operates as follows:
- **Storage Policy**: Based on API terms, data storage is limited to temporary records within the App.
- **Data Management**: This is a mechanism where communication is performed using your own API keys. The App does not store information permanently or redistribute it to third parties.

### 3. Liability for Damages
The developer shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, or incidental damages (booking issues, delays, disputes, economic losses, etc.) arising from the use of the App. Please perform final seat confirmation and booking through the official websites or service desks of each airline.

### 4. Intellectual Property Rights
Airline names, logos, aircraft names, etc., displayed in the App are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners.
