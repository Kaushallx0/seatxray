# Privacy Policy

SeatXray (hereinafter "the App") prioritizes your privacy and manages information as follows:

### 1. Data Management
The App does not collect personal information (name, itinerary, authentication credentials, etc.). There is no server for data management; all data is recorded only on your device or your specified storage locations.

### 2. Synchronization Feature
When using data synchronization, your data is protected as follows:
- **Storage Location**: Data is stored on your own cloud (Google Drive, Cloudflare, etc.) rather than the developer's server. The developer cannot access your data.
- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted on your device before being sent. No one can view the contents without your password.

### 3. Handling of API Credentials
The entered **API Key** and **API Secret** are used only for authentication with the airline systems. This information is stored only on your device or your specified synchronization destination and is never shared with third parties.

### 4. Compliance with Terms of Service
The App complies with the Amadeus Developers terms.
- Data is temporarily cached for smooth display, but we do not redistribute or permanently store data in violation of the terms.
- API requests are executed only in response to user actions (searches, scans, etc.) and are not performed automatically.

### 5. Statistics and Disclaimer
- Statistics on the number of API calls remain within the App and are not sent externally.
- Data handling during API communication is subject to the [Amadeus Privacy Policy](https://developers.amadeus.com/privacy-policy).
