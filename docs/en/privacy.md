# Privacy Policy

SeatXray (hereinafter "the App") manages information as follows:

### 1. Data Management

We do not collect personal information such as names, itineraries, or authentication credentials. There is no server managing your information; all data is recorded only on your device or your specified storage locations.

### 2. Synchronization Feature (Planned)

The cloud synchronization feature is currently under development, so all data is stored only within your local device.

Even when the synchronization feature is implemented in the future, it will use your own cloud storage (Google Drive, Cloudflare, etc.) rather than the developer's server, ensuring that the developer never accesses your data.
Transmitted data will be encrypted on the device, designed so that third parties cannot view the contents.

### 3. Handling of API Credentials

The entered API Key and API Secret are used only for authentication with airline systems and are saved only on your device or your specified synchronization destination. They are never shared with third parties.

### 4. Compliance with Terms of Service

We comply with the Amadeus Developers terms, caching data temporarily for smooth display purposes only, and do not redistribute or permanently store data in violation of the terms.

API requests are executed only in response to user actions such as searches or scans, and communication is never performed automatically without user intent.

### 5. Statistics and Disclaimer

Data such as statistics on the number of API calls are completed within the App and are not sent externally, but data handling during API communication is subject to the [Amadeus Privacy Policy](https://developers.amadeus.com/legal/privacy-policy).
